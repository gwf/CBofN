	* (VERSION) 2.1
	
	* (assoc.c, ca.c, misc.c, misc.h, plot.c, stutter.c) minor changes
	in source by Mike Miller to mesh in the new Mac plot driver.

	* (macplot.c) new Mac driver by Mike Miller.  Thanks Mike.

1998-10-23  Gary William Flake  <flake@godel>

	* (VERSION) 2.0

	* (README) updates for WIN32 crud.
	
	* (cbn98) subdiractory structure contains workspace and project
	files to maintain code under MS VC.  Note to myself: have I sold
	my soul?

	* (diffuse.c) now finishes when growth hits edge.  Otherwise,
	statistics get messed up and new growth beyond edge is extremely
	non-random.

	* (ALL) changed some default settings so that no command-line
	options typically do The Right Thing.
	
	* (winplot.cpp, win98.cpp) now have support for WIN32 graphics
	driver.  Why does this make me feel cheap?
	
	* (plot.c) made plot_mag belong to plot.c.  Now X11 and future
	WIN32 drivers reference it externally.	

	* (Makefile) yeah, it's extremely convoluted.  Deal with it.

	* (VERSION) 1.1.

	* (x11xplot.c) added X11 graphics driver which is based on x11 but
	works in color.  Color map is made from shifting hue from 0 to 360
	degress, with saturation and brightness set to 100 percent.
	
	* (ALL) reorganized distribution to have cleaner subdirectory
	structure.
